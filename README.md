# The Impatient Chef

The primary goal of this project is to read in information that is being stored on a web api. I chose to focus on a recipe website as I know quit a few 'foodies' who love to experiment with new recipes and ingredients. I am using the Spoonacular Api because it has the information necesary to create an interesting and comprehensive recipe website. 
It was named The Impatient Chef because each recipe takes less than one hour to prepare and cook.
